Gupaxx is a maintained fork of Gupax aiming to make monero easy to mine.

https://github.com/Cyrix126/gupaxx

Goal of Gupaxx:

- Easy UI (for beginners, automate as much as possible)
- Advanced controls available (for advanced users with complex setup)
- Decentralized (own node possible, use of p2pool, completely custodial)
- Efficient (best defaults for xmrig, participation in the P2Pool Bonus Hash Rate Raffle by XMRvsBEAST)
- Informative (stats/history available)
- Trustless (include only libre code)


ROADMAP:
https://github.com/Cyrix126/gupaxx/issues/68

IDEAS (probably getting into roadmap):
https://github.com/Cyrix126/gupaxx/blob/main/IDEAS.md

How the funds are used:

Every monero given will be converted to hours of work. When a goal is attained, a new release will occur, including elements present in the roadmap. A release is about 20 hours of work.
Bug fixing releases will not wait for a new funding goal to be completed.

Each time a goal is completed, a new goal of the same amount will occur to fund the next release.
Hours of work can also be used to develop/improve a library/program that will be used directly by Gupaxx. 



Proof of being Cyrix126:
The address to funding is the same as in the README of the github repository
