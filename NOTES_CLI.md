## Technical implementation

The cli args are managed by [clap](https://docs.rs/clap).
The code for managing current args from upstream will be replaced to use this crate.

The cli mode is enabled by passing the argument cli.
It will autostart xmrig/xvb processes.
p2pool process will be started if no address is given in args.
Otherwise, it will watch p2pool data and mine on it.

Each argument can be omitted if it's present in the state file.
